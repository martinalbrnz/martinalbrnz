# 👋 Hi, I’m @martinalbrnz
- 👀 I’m self taught, interested on Web development and AI/ML. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement AI/ML with Javascript.
- 📖 My current stack is MERN: MongoDB, Express, Node and React, but I'm willing to learn new things!
Also, I have made small programs with Python and Dart, both for personal projects and Data Analysis.
