# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @martinalbrnz
Iâ€™m self taught, interested on AI/ML and how to implement it with Javascript and Typescript on Web development.

My current stack is MERN and Tensorflow but I'm willing to learn new things!

Also, I have developed some small apps with Dart & Flutter!

Currently working on my portfolio.
